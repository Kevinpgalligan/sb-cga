* Version 1.0
*** TODO Porting
    Who woulda thunk people want to port this?
***** Guidelines & Principles
******* No #+sbcl #-sbcl in source files that exist for other reasons than portability.
******* Nikodemus will not maintain portability: SBCL port will be the canonical one.
******* Uglified code is allowed in shared files if it makes things faster for SBCL.
******* Uglified code is not allowed in shared if it makes code faster for implementation X.
	(Put it in an implementation specific file instead.)
***** TODO Rename to CL-CGA, maybe
      Iff there are at least two ports with maintainers that use them
      and will probably continue to do so.
*** WIP Manual
***** WIP Overview
      What SB-CGA is and isn't. What sort of things may change if you use
      the repo directly. Design choises relating to single/double floats.
***** WIP Vectors
******* TODO Using dynamic-extent
******* TODO optimizations done
***** WIP Matrices
******** DONE docstrings
***** WIP Root solvers
******* TODO QUADRIC-ROOTS-ABOVE
******* TODO QUADRIC-ROOTS
*** TODO VEC
***** TODO Additional operations
******* TODO NORMALIZED-TRANSFORM-POINT
	The reason these seem worthwhile is that they avoid memory
	traffic -- but it is probably not a good idea to expose
	them as part of the interface!
******* TODO Implement VEC-MIN/MAX using MINPS/MAXPS.
******* TODO Tests for these
*** TODO MATRIX
***** TODO MATRIX-, MATRIX+
***** TODO Tests
***** WIP MATRIX* (variable arity)
****** TODO MATRIX x scalar 
*** TODO Consider bang-style public API
* Version 2.0
*** TODO Separate transform type, used double-floats in matrices.
*** TODO Variable arity in vector arithmetic without memory traffic for intermediate results
